# PredictingIMDBScore

This project aims to predict IMDB scores for upcoming movies using the 'IMDB_data_Fall_2023' dataset. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature selection, and linear regression modeling.

Dataset
The dataset comprises 1930 movies with 42 attributes, focusing on predicting the 'imdb_score'.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Standardization of continuous variables, noise reduction, and outlier removal.
Model Selection: Multivariate linear regression, evaluating heteroskedasticity, and exploring variable importance.
Adjustments: Addressing issues with high budget movies in the test set.
Results
The final model's performance, challenges encountered, and areas for improvement are discussed. The model's predictions for 12 movies scheduled for release in November are detailed.

Limitations and Future Work
The report reflects on limitations encountered in applying the model to out-of-sample data and suggests potential improvements.
